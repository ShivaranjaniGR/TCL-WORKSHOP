## Custom TCL Scripting for ASIC Flow Automation: RTL-to-Timing Integration with Yosys and OpenTimer

SynthTime is a User Interface (UI) that will take RTL netlist & SDC constraints as an input, and will generate synthesized netlist & pre-layout timing report as an output. It uses Yosys open-source tool for synthesis and Opentimer to generate pre-layout timing reports.
