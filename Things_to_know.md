# Things to Know

## what is a Shell?
A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. It's a program that takes input from the user (commands), interprets it, and passes it to the system for execution.
Examples of popular shells include:

- Bash (Bourne Again Shell)

- Zsh (Z Shell)

- Sh (Bourne Shell)

- Csh (C Shell)

- Ksh (Korn Shell)

## what is a Shell script? 
A shell script is a simple text file that contains a series of commands written for the Unix/Linux shell (like bash, sh, or zsh). When you run this script, the shell executes each command in order.

it is  like a to-do list for your computer to automate tasks like:

- Running programs

- Setting up environments

- Launching tools/scripts with one command

## TCL script VS Shell script
| Feature               | **TCL Script** (`.tcl`)                                                              | **Shell Script** (`.sh`)                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üî§ **Language**       | Written in **TCL** (Tool Command Language)                                           | Written in **Shell scripting language** (e.g., Bash)                    |
| üîß **Used For**       | Automating **EDA tools**, parsing files, scripting inside tools                      | Automating **OS-level tasks**, file handling, launching programs        |
| ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run Using**      | `tclsh script.tcl`                                                                   | `bash script.sh` or `./script.sh`                                       |
| üìÑ **File Extension** | `.tcl`                                                                               | `.sh` (or none, but with executable permission)                         |
| üìö **Functionality**  | More like a **programming language** ‚Äì supports variables, loops, arrays, procedures | More like **command sequences** ‚Äì runs OS commands, calls other scripts |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Common Uses**    | Parsing Excel, generating reports, controlling flow in VLSI/EDA tools                | Setting paths, launching TCL scripts, automating CLI processes          |
| ü§ù **Together**       | Often **called from a shell script**                                                 | Can **call a TCL script** inside it                                     |


The shell script is the launcher.
The TCL script is the logic engine.

## what is a shebang line?
A shebang line is the very first line in a script file that tells the operating system which interpreter to use to run the script.
- #! is called a shebang

- It must be the first two characters in the file

- It‚Äôs followed by the full path to the interpreter (like Bash, tcsh, Python, etc.)

Without it, the system doesn‚Äôt know which language (bash, tcsh, python, etc.) the script is written in ‚Äî so it may:

‚ùå Throw an error

‚ùå Use the wrong shell (e.g., sh instead of tcsh)

‚ùå Misinterpret the syntax (leading to bugs like ‚Äúcommand not found‚Äù)

## Argument indexing in shell vs TCL
shell - $argv[1], $argv[2]
TCL - lindex $argv 0 , lindex $argv 1
