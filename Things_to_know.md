# Things to Know

## what is a Shell?
A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. It's a program that takes input from the user (commands), interprets it, and passes it to the system for execution.
Examples of popular shells include:

- Bash (Bourne Again Shell)

- Zsh (Z Shell)

- Sh (Bourne Shell)

- Csh (C Shell)

- Ksh (Korn Shell)

## what is a Shell script? 
A shell script is a simple text file that contains a series of commands written for the Unix/Linux shell (like bash, sh, or zsh). When you run this script, the shell executes each command in order.

it is  like a to-do list for your computer to automate tasks like:

- Running programs

- Setting up environments

- Launching tools/scripts with one command

## TCL script VS Shell script
| Feature               | **TCL Script** (`.tcl`)                                                              | **Shell Script** (`.sh`)                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üî§ **Language**       | Written in **TCL** (Tool Command Language)                                           | Written in **Shell scripting language** (e.g., Bash)                    |
| üîß **Used For**       | Automating **EDA tools**, parsing files, scripting inside tools                      | Automating **OS-level tasks**, file handling, launching programs        |
| ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run Using**      | `tclsh script.tcl`                                                                   | `bash script.sh` or `./script.sh`                                       |
| üìÑ **File Extension** | `.tcl`                                                                               | `.sh` (or none, but with executable permission)                         |
| üìö **Functionality**  | More like a **programming language** ‚Äì supports variables, loops, arrays, procedures | More like **command sequences** ‚Äì runs OS commands, calls other scripts |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Common Uses**    | Parsing Excel, generating reports, controlling flow in VLSI/EDA tools                | Setting paths, launching TCL scripts, automating CLI processes          |
| ü§ù **Together**       | Often **called from a shell script**                                                 | Can **call a TCL script** inside it                                     |


The shell script is the launcher.
The TCL script is the logic engine.
